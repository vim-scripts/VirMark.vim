Based on some advice given by Benji Fisher on utilizing a buffer local variable to store the current position.  It becomes a virtual mark as it doesn't take up one of the normal vim 'marks' a-zA-Z, instead it uses a variable.  They are local to a buffer, just like normal marks.  Useful for scripts that need to keep position, but don't want to change the user's mark setting.
